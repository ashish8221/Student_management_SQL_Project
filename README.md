Student Management System - SQL Project

Description

This project is a SQL-based Student Management System database designed to manage student information, courses, batches, and enrollments. It allows for performing various operations and queries related to students, courses, and their enrollments. This database can be helpful for educational institutions looking to maintain and analyze student and course data.

The project is created using MySQL and contains tables for storing student details, course details, batch information, and student enrollments. The project also contains multiple SQL queries that can be used to retrieve relevant data for reporting and analysis.

Features

	1.	Student Information: Store student details such as name, date of birth, city, qualification, email, and phone number.
	2.	Course Information: Store details of the courses like course name, category, fees, and duration.
	3.	Batch Information: Store batch details, including batch start date, strength, and associated course.
	4.	Enrollment Information: Track which students are enrolled in which batches, along with the enrollment date.
	5.	Queries for Analysis: The project includes a list of SQL queries to retrieve data insights such as total students from a city, students with missing email/phone details, and total revenue from courses.

 How to Run the Project

	1.	Install MySQL: Make sure you have MySQL installed on your machine.
	2.	Create the Database: Run the following command to create the database:

     CREATE DATABASE Student_management;
    USE Student_management;

  3.	Run SQL Script: Execute the SQL script to create the tables and insert the sample data into the database.
	4.	Run Queries: Use the provided queries to analyze and retrieve data from the Student_management database.

Future Enhancements

	•	Add triggers for automatic student status updates.
	•	Create views for easier data extraction and reporting.
	•	Implement user roles for managing data access.
